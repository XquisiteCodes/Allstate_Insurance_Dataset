# Allstate_Insurance_Dataset
This repository was created for the analysis of the Allstate Insurance dataset from Kaggle. The aim of the analysis is to generate a predictive model that could estimate the loss cost a customer is due in the event of an accident. The data was clean and randomized because the company wanted to maintain anonymity of it's clients.
